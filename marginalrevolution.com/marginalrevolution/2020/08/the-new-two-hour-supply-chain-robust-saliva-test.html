    <div class="pf-content"><p>The FDA <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/15/yales-rapid-covid-19-saliva-test-receives-fda-emergency-use-authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has just approved</a> a new and important Covid-19 test:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="dquo">“</span>Wide-spread testing is critical for our control efforts. We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample. If cheap alternatives like SalivaDirect can be implemented across the country, we may finally get a handle on this pandemic, even before a vaccine,” said Grubaugh.</p>
<p>One of the team’s goals was to eliminate the expensive saliva collection tubes that other companies use to preserve the virus for detection. <a class="extlink" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.20165233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a separate study led by Wyllie and the team at the Yale School of Public Health, and recently published on medRxiv</a>, they found that SARS-CoV-2 is stable in saliva for prolonged periods at warm temperatures, and that preservatives or specialized tubes are not necessary for collection of saliva.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course this part warmed my heart (doubly):</p>
<blockquote><p>The related research was funded by the NBA, National Basketball Players Association, and a Fast Grant from the Emergent Ventures at the Mercatus Center, George Mason University.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NBA had the wisdom to use its unique &#8220;bubble&#8221; to run multiple tests on players at once, to see how reliable the less-known tests would be.  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fda-authorizes-a-cheap-fast-saliva-testand-the-nba-is-involved-11597508654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This WSJ article</a> &#8212; &#8220;Experts say it could be key to increasing the nation’s testing capacity&#8221; &#8212; has the entire NBA back story.  At an estimated $10 a pop, this could especially be a game-changer for poorer nations.  Furthermore, it has the potential to make pooled testing much easier as well.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167791v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the research pre-print</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The critical component of our approach is to use saliva instead of respiratory swabs, which enables non-invasive frequent sampling and reduces the need for trained healthcare professionals during collection. Furthermore, we simplified our diagnostic test by (1) not requiring nucleic acid preservatives at sample collection, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple proteinase K and heat treatment step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. We validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize the risk for supply chain issues. Regardless of our tested combination of reagents and instruments from different vendors, we found that SalivaDirect is highly sensitive with a limit of detection of 6-12 SARS-CoV-2 copies/μL.</p></blockquote>
<p>No need to worry and fuss about RNA extraction now.  Here is <a href="https://covidtrackerct.com/about-salivadirect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best simple explanation of the whole thing</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers are <a href="https://twitter.com/YaleSPH/status/1294696508974039041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not seeking to commercialize</a> their advance, rather they are making it available for the general benefit of mankind.  Here is <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGrubaugh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathan Grubaugh on Twitter</a>.  Here is <a href="https://twitter.com/awyllie13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Wyllie</a>, also a Kiwi and a Kevin Garnett fan.  A further implication of course is that the NBA bubble is not &#8220;just sports,&#8221; but also has boosted innovation by enabling data collection.</p>
<p>All good news of course, and Fast at that.  And <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/15/fda-clears-saliva-test-for-covid-19-opening-door-to-wider-testing/?utm_content=buffere880d&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This could be one the first major game changers in fighting the pandemic,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1294654256763609090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted Andy Slavitt</a>, a former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration, who expects testing capacity to be expanded significantly. “Rarely am I this enthusiastic… They are turning testing from a bespoke suit to a low-cost commodity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29667299/fda-allowing-saliva-based-test-funded-nba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coverage from Zach Lowe</a>.  I am very pleased with the course of Fast Grants more generally, and you will be hearing more about it in the future.</p>

If they truly want to \&quot;making [the test] available for the general benefit of mankind\&quot;, then they should license to all labs without conditions as any increase in supply will lower prices and increase quantity.  The way to keep tests inexpensive is to increase supply, not restrict it.

But let&#039;s not take a victory lap quite yet. First, the tests won&#039;t be free: somebody has to obtain the test kits and collect and test the samples. In the NBA, it&#039;s the NBA. What&#039;s suggested is that employers will bear the responsibility and cost. Maybe. Which brings me to my second point: the sharp decline in testing recently, including in states that had been experiencing a spike in cases. How good is the news about the decline in cases when the decline is attributable to a decline in testing. In my state the results of testing are what are used to determine whether businesses, schools, churches, etc. can reopen, or reopen without distancing and other safeguards. The usual standard is that less than 10% of tests are positive (usually for some stated period, such as seven days). Will this new, simpler, faster, and much cheaper test have a significant effect on the number of tests? That&#039;s implicit in the blog post. But I dunno. If I am an employer, for example, don&#039;t I have an incentive not to test, since additional testing may cause the number of new cases and the percentage of positive tests to go up, risking a return to more restrictive business operations or even closure. And this doesn&#039;t even consider the politics of testing. Today, everything in America is political, even public health. But not to lose sight of the good news, thank you to those who are responsible for this achievement, including our host.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160136712,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Chris Screwtape&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-08-16 06:47:09&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Looks good.

This is a good change for this protocol but not novel.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Removing nucleic acid preservatives is a good change (simpler, cheaper faster) but possibly may lead to a reduced test performance if the tests get delayed in the mail between spit collection and processing at the test center.  (We do know that mail delivery is getting delayed at the moment.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s say current time from test to result is 3-7 days. Slow PCR tests take 4 hours.  Fast ones take 45 minutes or less.  Logistics, sample collection transport, and time in signing off on the results and communicating them take 90-98% of the time.

But let&#039;s not take a victory lap quite yet. First, the tests won&#039;t be free: somebody has to obtain the test kits and collect and test the samples. In the NBA, it&#039;s the NBA. What&#039;s suggested is that employers will bear the responsibility and cost. Maybe. Which brings me to my second point: the sharp decline in testing recently, including in states that had been experiencing a spike in cases. How good is the news about the decline in cases when the decline is attributable to a decline in testing. In my state the results of testing are what are used to determine whether businesses, schools, churches, etc. can reopen, or reopen without distancing and other safeguards. The usual standard is that less than 10% of tests are positive (usually for some stated period, such as seven days). Will this new, simpler, faster, and much cheaper test have a significant effect on the number of tests? That&#039;s implicit in the blog post. But I dunno. If I am an employer, for example, don&#039;t I have an incentive not to test, since additional testing may cause the number of new cases and the percentage of positive tests to go up, risking a return to more restrictive business operations or even closure. And this doesn&#039;t even consider the politics of testing. Today, everything in America is political, even public health. But not to lose sight of the good news, thank you to those who are responsible for this achievement, including our host.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160136712,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Chris Screwtape&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-08-16 06:47:09&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Looks good.

This is a good change for this protocol but not novel.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Removing nucleic acid preservatives is a good change (simpler, cheaper faster) but possibly may lead to a reduced test performance if the tests get delayed in the mail between spit collection and processing at the test center.  (We do know that mail delivery is getting delayed at the moment.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s say current time from test to result is 3-7 days. Slow PCR tests take 4 hours.  Fast ones take 45 minutes or less.  Logistics, sample collection transport, and time in signing off on the results and communicating them take 90-98% of the time.
